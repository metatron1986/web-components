## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It is crucial to think thoroughly about the HTML structure first. A well thought-out structure is essential not only for the organization of the code, but also for later styling. When styling, it is advisable to proceed systematically: You should work from the top down, completing each section before moving on to the next.

### Continued development

In the next development phase I plan to switch the project to a grid system. Instead of the traditional media queries, I want to use container queries. This will allow for contextual adaptation of content that no longer depends on fixed breakpoints. This approach is future-oriented and in line with current best practices in web development. Container queries offer a more flexible and modular design that facilitates project maintenance and scalability.

### Useful resources

Currently, I have not called on any external resources, as I have been able to implement the project independently. However, appropriate resources will be brought in for future development.
